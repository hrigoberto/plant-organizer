# Plant Organizer

This Project will act as a cloud-based database, storing a series of differing species of plants, and their attributes as it pertains to growing them in the correct season.

- Roadmap for MVP
  - Should be filterable by any parameter
  - Should be searchable
  - Easy to read and intuitive to use


- Possible future features
  - Eventually should allow users to submit data entries for different plant species
  - Eventually should allow for Super users to edit entries in the database and verify sources for user submissions
